# 0mq-clj
Something to learn 0mq and clojure

There is no need to install jzmq as this uses the pure java jeromq.
You just need to install 'boot-clj' and then start the client and server.

```bash
boot run-client
boot run-server
```

The order you start them should not matter. 
That is one of the nice things about 0mq.
